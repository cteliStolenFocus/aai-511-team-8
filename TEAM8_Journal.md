### 07/16/2023
- First meeting
- Intro, goals, tasks, resources
- Jupyter notebook framework - Due date 7/19/23 (Chris)
- All to work on the ideas for building a CNN and LSTM related model - Due date 7/23/23 (Adam, Iknna, Chris)
- Discuss all on meeting due date 7/23/23 @ 18:00 (Adam will organize)
### 07/19/2023
- Checked in feature extraction code
- Checked in picked data frame
- Started the Project Management documentation
- Team code review of file load code
### 07/25/2023
- Meeting #2
- Discuss the dataset: How the Pickle file works, verifying it is capturing the correct data
- Assign tasks:
  - Chris:
    - Continue to code the dataset,
    - verify Pickle file, tune current def.
  - Adam:
    - Code review for what is done
    - suggest tuning if needed
    - Update documentation
    - Ask about the LSTM and the CNN
  - Ikenna:
    - Tune the LSTM Model, update info
- Started work on creating an initial model the uses LSTM
### 07/27/2023
- Ikenna coded 3 versions of LSTM with different setting
- Each setting has a score 
### 07/30/2023
- Chris Installed FluidSynth/Midi2Audio to conver to wav files
    - Converting to wav files
    - Using Sound Fond TimGM6mb.sf2. 
    - Once the files are converted recreate features using librosa
- Group meeting #3:
    - Chris preparing a better data file for extraction
    - Adam to review all code
    - Adam to update documentation
 - Adam organized current code
