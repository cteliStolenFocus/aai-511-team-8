Loading a MIDI dataset and working with various versions of LSTM and CNN to work a model that predicts the Compsoer. 
Utilizing a pickle file for the data to load
pickle fir is due to a multiple file collection of all the MIDI files, better to work into a single format
Creat 4 Model versions: LSTM 1 layer, LSTM 3 Layer (2 ver) 3. CNN numerical, 4. CNN image data
See project document for all details
